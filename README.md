# claude-chats-browser

**Your chats. Your machine. Actually readable.**

A cross-platform desktop app (Qt 6 / C++20) for browsing, searching, and reading
[claude.ai](https://claude.ai) data exports offline. The official export is a single
giant JSON file that no human can read; this app turns years of conversations into
a fast, pleasant, fully searchable chat browser.

---

## The Problem

claude.ai lets you export your data, but what you get is barely usable:

| What you get | Why it hurts |
|--------------|--------------|
| One `conversations.json`, potentially 100+ MB | No viewer opens it comfortably, let alone pleasantly |
| Messages as raw content blocks (text, thinking, tool calls) | Unreadable without reconstructing the structure |
| Conversations are trees (edit/retry branches), stored flat | Branches are invisible in the raw JSON |
| Deleted chats appear as nameless, empty skeletons | Noise you can't distinguish from data loss |
| No search across the export | Two years of conversations, zero findability |

## The Solution

claude-chats-browser imports the export **once** into a local SQLite database with an
FTS5 full-text index, then gives you a native desktop UI over it:

```text
┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│  claude.ai       │      │  Importer        │      │  Qt Quick UI     │
│  export zip      │─────►│                  │─────►│                  │
│                  │      │  SQLite + FTS5   │      │  browse, search, │
│  (huge JSON)     │      │  (local file)    │      │  read, export    │
└──────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘
```

- **Instant startup** — parse the 100+ MB JSON once, never again
- **Full-text search** across every conversation you ever had
- **Merge-by-UUID imports** — feed it multiple exports over time; it keeps the union, never destroys anything
- **Honest history** — deleted-chat tombstones are shown greyed-out (date + message count), not hidden

## Status

**Pre-scaffold.** The data layer is fully analysed (export schema, content block types,
branching, tombstones — see [.claude/CLAUDE.md](.claude/CLAUDE.md)) and the fetch tooling
works. The application itself is in design; this README describes the agreed plan.

## Planned Features

1. **Conversation browser** — sidebar with search-as-you-type (FTS5), date filters, project grouping
2. **Reader** — markdown rendering, collapsible thinking blocks, tool calls as expandable chips, inline attachments
3. **Branch navigation** — conversations are trees; edit/retry branches become navigable
4. **Artifact extraction** — reconstruct artifacts from tool-call history, preview and export to disk
5. **Stats dashboard** — activity over time, model and tool usage

## Privacy

This app processes your private conversations. In one sentence: **nothing ever leaves
your machine unless you explicitly ask it to.** The full privacy model — offline-first,
no telemetry, user-initiated network access only, all data confined to the gitignored
`data/` directory — is defined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) § Privacy Model, the
canonical source.

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Windows  | Planned (primary development platform) |
| Linux    | Planned |
| macOS    | Planned |

All three are first-class targets.

## Requirements

- **C++20** compiler (MSVC 19.30+, GCC 12+, or Clang 15+)
- **CMake** 3.24+
- **Ninja** build system
- **Qt 6.x** (Quick and Sql modules)
- **Python** 3.10+ (for `tools/` scripts only)

## Building

Build presets will be defined when the application scaffold lands; this section will
then become the canonical source for build commands.

## Getting Your Export

1. On [claude.ai](https://claude.ai): **Settings → Privacy → Export data**
2. You'll receive a download link by email
3. Extract the zip into `data/` (gitignored), e.g. `data/export-2026-07-20/`

## Tools

### `tools/backfill_conversations.py`

Fetches your conversations directly from the claude.ai backend API using your own
browser session — useful for grabbing conversations newer than your last export.
Requires `curl_cffi` (`pip install curl_cffi`; plain HTTP clients are blocked by
Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting).

```bash
python tools/backfill_conversations.py list  --export data/export-2026-07-20   # count content-less conversations
python tools/backfill_conversations.py test  --export data/export-2026-07-20   # check your session key works
python tools/backfill_conversations.py fetch --export data/export-2026-07-20   # download (resumable, rate-limited)
python tools/backfill_conversations.py merge --export data/export-2026-07-20   # write conversations-merged.json
```

The session key is read from a hidden interactive prompt (or `CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY`) and
is never stored.

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Storage | SQLite + FTS5 | Instant startup, real full-text search, single-file database |
| SQLite driver | Qt's bundled QSQLITE | FTS5 compiled in, no extra dependency |
| UI | Qt Quick (QML) | Fluid chat UI, cross-platform |
| Data models | C++ `QAbstractListModel` | Logic in C++, QML stays declarative |
| Markdown | Qt's native CommonMark support | No extra dependency |
| Import strategy | Merge-by-UUID snapshots | Multiple exports form a union over time; nothing is ever destroyed |
| Schema handling | Tolerant parsing | The export format evolved over years — every field optional, unknown block types preserved raw |
| Abstractions | None until a concrete second use case | Don't over-engineer |
| Licence | GPL v3 | Consistent with my other projects |
